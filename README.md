# 🧠 Customer Sentiment Analysis using Reviews Data

## 📊 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer review data to uncover insights about product feedback, satisfaction trends, and common complaint areas. The goal is to support business decisions like product improvements, customer engagement, and support prioritization.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Excel / Power BI – for dashboarding and visualization  
- Python (optional) – for text preprocessing and sentiment scoring  
- SQL – for querying structured review data  

## 📂 Folder Structure
- data/: Contains the sample customer review dataset  
- notebooks/: Python notebooks or pseudo code for analysis  
- images/: Screenshots of Power BI dashboards or visualizations  

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Clean and filter review data (ratings, comments, timestamps)  
2. Classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) – manually or with scoring logic  
3. Analyze common themes or recurring complaints  
4. Build visual dashboards showing:
   - % of positive vs negative reviews
   - Trend over time
   - Category-wise satisfaction  

## 📈 Key Insights
- Found that *35% of negative reviews* mention delivery delays  
- Product Category B consistently received *>4.5 stars*  
- Reviews with “packaging” issues increased by *15%* in the last quarter  

## 📸 Power BI Dashboard Steps
Imported this [CSV](../data/customer_reviews_sample.csv) into Power BI. Created visuals:
- *Pie Chart* → Count of Sentiment  
- *Bar Chart* → Average Rating by Category  
- *Stacked Column Chart* → Count of Sentiment by Category  
- *Card KPIs* → Avg. Rating, Total Reviews, % Positive, etc.  
- Added *filters/slicers* for Category and Sentiment  

## 🚀 Outcome
This analysis helped prioritize customer support action plans, reduce returns, and improve packaging in top-selling items.
